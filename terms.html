<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p>Effective Date: July 6, 2025</p>

<p>Welcome to RemoteFix. By accessing or using our website and services, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. Please read them carefully.</p>

<h2>1. Overview</h2>
<p>RemoteFix provides remote troubleshooting and support services for TV remotes, HDMI input issues, and cable box setups. These services are offered on a per-use, monthly, yearly, or lifetime subscription basis.</p>

<h2>2. Payments</h2>
<p>All payments are processed securely via Stripe. By purchasing a plan, you agree to Stripeâ€™s <a href="https://stripe.com/legal">Terms of Service</a> and authorize RemoteFix to charge your card in accordance with your selected plan.</p>

<h2>3. Refunds</h2>
<p>We offer a satisfaction guarantee on per-use payments. If your issue is not resolved, contact us within 3 days for a full refund. Subscriptions can be cancelled anytime, but we do not prorate partial months.</p>

<h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
<p>You agree to use our services only for lawful purposes. You are responsible for providing accurate information, following on-screen instructions, and not misusing the service.</p>

<h2>5. Service Limitations</h2>
<p>RemoteFix provides guidance and support but cannot guarantee compatibility with every TV or remote. Most issues relate to HDMI input confusion, but hardware malfunctions may require in-person service.</p>

<h2>6. Account Access</h2>
<p>Some features may require account creation. You agree to keep your login credentials secure and not share them with others.</p>

<h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>All website content, branding, and instructional materials are the property of RemoteFix and may not be copied or reused without permission.</p>

<h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>We use third-party tools like Stripe for payments and Intercom for live chat. Your use of the service is also subject to their terms and privacy policies.</p>

<h2>9. Termination</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access to our services if you violate these terms or misuse the platform.</p>

<h2>10. Changes to Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms of Service at any time. Continued use of the service after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.</p>

<h2>11. Contact</h2>
